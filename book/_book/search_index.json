These Course Notes are a complement to the Lecture. Contents The Lecture is divided in the following Chapters, and each Chapter contains several themes. Number Name Themes Status 1 Introduction Intro, Mathematics reminder and Combinatorics. Fine-tuning‚Ä¶ 2 Elements of Set Theory For Probability Random variables, Trees, Venn diagram, Conditional probability, Independence &amp; Bayes‚Äô theorem. Fine-tuning‚Ä¶ 3 Axiomatic Foundations of Proability Probability Axioms, Illustrations of use, Conditional probability, Independence &amp; Bayes‚Äô theorem. Fine-tuning‚Ä¶ 4 Discrete random variables Definitions, Expected value and variance, Binomial, Poisson, Negative binomial and Hypergeometric Writing 5 Continuous random variables Definitions, Expected value and variance, Cumulative distribution function (cdf) and Probability density function (pdf), Some important examples: Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, Normal, logNormal, Student‚Äôs t, Relationships Writing 6 Limit Theorems Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Writing 7 Bivariate Discrete Random Variables Writing 8 Elements of Simulation Numerical methods for the simulation of random variable with a given CDF. Writing Practical information Who we are Daniel FLORES AGREDA Data Science Course Developer and Instructor Daniel.Flores@unige.ch Edoardo VIGNOTTO Teaching and Research Assistant Edoardo.Vignotto@unige.ch Lectures The Lectures will take place over Zoom on Thursdays from 12h to 14h. Lectures will consist on a presentation of the contents of the class. During the class, there will be some exercises. You are invited to download the app Wooclap Exercises Q&amp;A sessions on the exercises will take place on Thursdays from 16 to 18 over Zoom. We will soon be making available a platform to raise and vote on your questions. The problem set and their solutions will be posted on-line one week before. You must are warmly reminded to try the exercises by yourselves before looking at the solution. If you are blocked in a point, or you don‚Äôt understand a step, you can raise your questions to the T.A. Problem sets are not graded. Tools Moodle. All the resources of the class will be available in this page. Wooclap A Web application allowing to choose among a wide range of questions (multiple choice, word cloud, visual questions) Reference Aside from these Course Notes, you can check: A first course in probability, S. Ross (any edition), Ed: Pearson New International Edition, cited as Ross (2014). We will not be following the content of this book beat-by-beat, but it is available for reference and/or in case you want a different explanation or go deeper in the context of the Course. "]]
