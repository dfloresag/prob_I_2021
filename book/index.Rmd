Hello and Welcome to this introductory Lecture in Probability! 

These Course Notes are a complement to the Lecture Probability I. 

</center> 

## Contents {-}

The Lecture is divided in the following Chapters, and each Chapter contains several themes.

| Number| Name  | Themes | Status |
|:------:|:-------|:-------|:-------:| 
| 1 |**Introduction** | Intro, Mathematics reminder and Combinatorics. | ‚òëÔ∏è | 
| 2 |**Elements of Set Theory For Probability** | Random variables, Trees, Venn diagram, Conditional probability, Independence & Bayes' theorem. | ‚òëÔ∏è | 
| 3 |**Axiomatic Foundations of Probability** | Probability Axioms, Illustrations of use | ‚òëÔ∏è | 
| 4 | **Discrete random variables**| Definitions, Expected value and variance,  Binomial, Poisson, Negative binomial and Hypergeometric | üîß | 
| 5 | **Continuous random variables** | Definitions, Expected value and variance, Cumulative distribution function (cdf) and Probability density function (pdf), Some important examples: Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, Normal, logNormal, Student's t, Relationships | üîß |
| 6 | **Limit Theorems** | Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) | üìù | 
| 7 | **Bivariate Discrete Random Variables** | | üìù |
| 8 | **Elements of Simulation** | Numerical methods for the simulation of random variable with a given CDF. | üìù |

- ‚òëÔ∏è = Ready (almost surely with typos).
- üîß = Fine-tuning.
- üìù = Writing.

### Lectures {-}

The Lectures will take place over [Zoom](https://unige.zoom.us/j/98257116213?pwd=S2VkVWwzbys5SzcyeUMyVERlV1c2UT09) on **Thursdays** from **12h to 14h**. 

- Lectures will consist on a presentation of the contents of the class. 

- During the class, there will be some exercises. You are invited to download the app [Wooclap](https://www.wooclap.com)

### Exercises {-}

- **Q&A sessions on the exercises will take place on Thursdays from 16 to 18 over Zoom**. We will soon be making available a platform to raise and vote on your questions.

- **The problem set and their solutions will be posted on-line one week before**. You must are warmly reminded to try the exercises by yourselves before looking at the solution. If you are blocked in a point, or you don't understand a step, you can raise your questions to the T.A.

- **Problem sets are not graded.**

### Tools {-}

- [Moodle](https://moodle.unige.ch/course/view.php?id=7133). All the resources of the class will be available in this page.

- [Wooclap](https://www.wooclap.com) A Web application allowing to choose among a wide range of questions (multiple choice, word cloud, visual questions)
