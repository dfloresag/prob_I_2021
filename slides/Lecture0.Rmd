Data is produced at a breakneck pace. Generated from surveys but also from devices and (more or less invasive) websites and apps. 

This example comes from a survey on the relocation and migration. Here one can see the amounts  of local migration between cantons. 

Accessing this data could inform decision-makers on projects such as housing or mobility infrastructure. It can inform economists on the reasons why some cantons become more attractive over time, etc. 

But this data needs to be analised in order to make value.

Today, we have enormous algorithmic and computing power,but in the end, it those methods rely to a great extent on statistical methods.

Let me illustrate with a very simple model how to characterise a simple 

---
# Illustration : Price of a Stock

Prices of stocks move up on down according to the wills of investors.

--

To a great extent they are **uncertain**

???
We could model these fluctuations using a probability model, e.g :

--

Let $S_0$ denote the price of the Stock at time $t_0$, and consider that:

- with **probability $p$** the stock price increases by a factor $u>1$, and 

- with **probability $1-p$** the price decreases by a factor $d<1$. 

--

Then, the price at time $t_1$  

- $S_1 = uS_0$ if the price goes up,

- $S_1=dS_0$  if the price goes down. 

Let us set $S_0=1$ (US Dollar) and the factors $u=2$ (i.e. doubling the price) and $d=1/2$ (i.e. halving the price). 

**What can we say about the price at time $t_2$?**]

### Probability Tree Diagram. 

- Probability of successive outcomes:  **_multiply_ the probabilities** on the edges 

- More than one path leading to a given outcome:  **_sum_ the total probabilty** of the edges outcome.  

--

Hence, with $S_0 = 1$: 

- The probability of $S_2 = u^2 = 4$ is $p^2$

- The probability of $S_2 = d^2 = 4$ is $(1-p)^2$

- The probability of $S_2 = ud = 1$ is $(1-p)p+p(1-p)$
